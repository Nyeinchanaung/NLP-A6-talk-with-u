I’m currently working as a Product Manager at Village Link, one of the subsidiaries of Myanma Awba. I am mainly responsible for product management, UI/UX research, user analysis, QA testing, and the product launch of our company’s many products. I am leading the development of a delivery social agricultural platform with registered farmers. My ability to understand the system and database design allowed me to migrate the hundred thousand user-generated datasets from the legacy system to a completely new platform in 2021.  I started my career in the tech industry as a developer while I was studying Business Information Technology. After that, I moved forward into product development and management when I found my enthusiasm for the art of product development lifecycle applying Agile Methodology. However, I am still actively sharing the technical workload by reviewing the source code for quality assurance and taking responsibility for the server deployment using different cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Digital Ocean.  I have experience organizing hackathons a few years back from now, before the pandemic. We also initiated the UniHackChallenge hackathon series that focused on university students applying their skills from the classroom to real-world problems. I contributed as a mentor such as The Hackathon 2018 and 2019 organized by Ooredoo Myanmar, AngelHack Hackathon Myanmar 2018.  Moreover, I participated in several hackathons related to my career. Along the journey, I was awarded the second prize in the YIC AG-Hack Hackathon, which was designed to ideate solutions that support the Agri-sector, organized by Seedstars, powered by Myanma Awba in Jun 2019. Our team developed a mobile application, that can guide how to use Agri-input products, with augmented reality technology. As my second achievement, after I joined my current organization, we participated in the I2N challenge program which aimed at identifying innovative solutions for nutritious food.
